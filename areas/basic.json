For\nexample, using an attack prevents the player from attacking again before N\nseconds, but meanwhile the player can still ready a defensive command or see\ntheir statistics.\n\nAnacronia V4 implements a queue system in which all the unknown commands are\nweeded out of the command queue, and commands are executed in order of\npriority. Adding specific queue types (attack, defense, movement) is on the\nroadmap and should be fairly easy to implement.\n\nThere is not yet a command which lists all available commands.\n\nThe command \"&YCOMMANDS&^\" allows one to see which commands are currently in\ntheir queue, ready to be executed whenever a player's delay allows it.\n"
