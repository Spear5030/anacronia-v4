0 ANACRONIA V4~
&WAnacronia V4&^ is the fourth rewrite of a Multi User Dungeon (MUD), a
multi-user internet gaming system. It is written in the Perl programming
language, and uses "modern" technologies and modules, such as AnyEvent,
Gearman, and Memcache.

~

0 HELP HLIST~
To use the help facility, type: &Yhelp &R<keyword>&^
    For example, "&Yhelp anacronia&^".
For a (long) list of help topics, type: &Yhlist <free text>&^
    For example, "&Yhlist mud&^".

You can use &Yhlist&^ to narrow down the list of pages to the ones which contain
the text you specify. For example, "&Yhlist v4&^" would show the help pages whose
keywords contain that word.
~

0 COMMANDS COMMAND QUEUE QUEUES~
In many MUDs commands are parsed and executed in a first-come first-served
fashion: if the character is currently performing an action which delays
(casting a spell for example), any other command (including non-delaying ones
such as &YSCORE&^) need to wait for the first command to be executed.

In other mode modern MUDs there may be multiple command queues which allow the
player to perform delaying actions which don't overlap with each other. For
example, using an attack prevents the player from attacking again before N
seconds, but meanwhile the player can still ready a defensive command or see
their statistics.

Anacronia V4 implements a queue system in which all the unknown commands are
weeded out of the command queue, and commands are executed in order of
priority. Adding specific queue types (attack, defense, movement) is on the
roadmap and should be fairly easy to implement.

There is not yet a command which lists all available commands.

The command "&YCOMMANDS&^" allows one to see which commands are currently in
their queue, ready to be executed whenever a player's delay allows it.
~

0 SHOUT~
When you &Yshout phrase&^ the &Yphrase&^ will be shown to all the users currently
connected to the game.

The &Yphrase&^ can contain coloured text (see the command &Ycolors&^).

This command delays.
~

0 COLORS COLOURS~
You can use the &Ycolors&^ command to show the various characters which can be
combined in order to shout or display ANSI coloured strings.

The command will also show you 255 ANSI colours and shades of grey, so you can
determine whether your terminal supports them.
~

0 WHO ONLINE~
The &YWHO&^ command displays a list of all the currently connected users.

For each, it will display whether their client supports any of the MUD-recognised
extensions (MCCP, etc).

Admins are able to see the IP and port of each connection.
~

0 STATS STATISTICS~
The &YSTATS&^ command displays statistics about your connection.

It will show you what the MUD recognises as being your terminal's width/height, as
well as which of the MUD-recognised extensions (MCCP, MXP, etc) your client seems
to be supporting, and whether they are enabled.

Additionally, the command shows some server statistics, such as the number of
characters and data bytes sent to the connections, and the resulting current MCCP2
compression ratio.
~

0 @SHUTDOWN SHUTDOWN~
The administrative command &Y@SHUTDOWN&^ allows an admin to shutdown the MUD.

The service will not be restarted, and the executable will show some statistics about
the connections and the data transferred during the time the MUD was running.
