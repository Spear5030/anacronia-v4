~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! should repeat the last command you typed.
It is NOT implemented.
~

0 HELP~
To use the help facility, type:

    &Whelp &R<keyword>&^

For example, "help anacronia".

For a (long) list of help topics, type:

    &Whlist <free text>&^

You can use hlist to narrow down the list of pages to the ones which contain
the text you specify. For example, "hlist v4" would show the help pages which
contain that word.

0 ANACRONIA V4~
&WAnacronia V4&^ is the fourth rewrite of a Multi User Dungeon (MUD), a
multi-user internet gaming system. It is written in the Perl programming
language, and uses "modern" technologies and modules, such as AnyEvent,
Gearman, and Memcache.

0 COMMANDS COMMAND QUEUE QUEUES~
In many MUDs commands are parsed and executed in a first-come first-served fashion:
if the character is currently performing an action which delays (casting a spelli for
example), any other command (including non-delaying ones such as SCORE) need to wait
for the first command to be executed.
In other mode modern MUDs there may be multiple command queues which allow the player
to perform delaying actions which don't overlap with each other. For example, using
an attack prevents the player from attacking again before N seconds, but meanwhile
the player can still ready a defensive command or see their statistics.
Anacronia V4 implements a queue system in which all the unknown commands are weeded
out of the command queue, and commands are executed in order of priority. Adding
specific queue types (attack, defense, movement) is on the roadmap and should be
fairly easy to implement.
