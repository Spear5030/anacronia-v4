The MUD server probes the client for, and supports, the following Telnet protocol extensions:

COMPRESS2 (also called MCCP2)
    Upon client connection, the server will send IAC WILL COMPRESS2.
    If no reply is received, or IAC WONT COMPRESS2 is received, no compression is performed.
    If the client sends IAC DO COMPRESS2, the server will:
    - append IAC SB COMPRESS2 IAC SE to signal starting compressing data
    - enable the "mccp" flag for the client
    - start sending compressed data until the socket is closed
    - TODO see what happens on receiving IAC DONT COMPRESS2 from the client

MXP
    Upon client connection, the server will send IAC WILL MXP.
    If no reply is received, or IAC WONT MXP is received, MXP is not enabled.
    If the client sends IAC DO MXP, the server will:
    - append IAC SB MXP IAC SE to signal starting MXP
    - append ESC [ 7 z to signal starting of an MXP mode
    - flag the client as able to accept MXP data
    - TODO see what happens when changing it during the connection

MSP
    Upon client connection, the server will send IAC WILL MSP.
    Currently this doesn't do much.

TTYPE
    Upon client connection, the server will send IAC DO TTYPE.
    If the client sends IAC WILL TTYPE, the server will ignore it.
    If the client sends IAC SB TTYPE <data> IAC SB, the server will interpret the data
    as being the terminal name of the client.

NAWS
    Upon client connection, the server will send IAC DO NAWS
    If the client sends IAC WILL NAWS, the server will ignore it.
    If the client sends IAC SB NAWS <data> IAC SB, the server will interpret the data
    as being the width and height of the client.

MCP
    Upon client connection, the server will advertise its ability to do MCP, sending:
    #$#mcp version: 2.1 to 2.1\r\n
    ...
